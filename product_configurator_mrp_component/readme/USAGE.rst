* When the parent product is configured, the system will look for the first BoM for that product and cycle through the configurable components.
* If a product variant doesn't exist for the configurable component then one will be created with the matching values in the config wizard.
* The parent product BoM will then be modified with a new bom line(s) and configuration set(s) for the new configurable component variants.
* The new parent product variant will be created if one doesn't exist and it's BoM will contain the new configurable components lines.
